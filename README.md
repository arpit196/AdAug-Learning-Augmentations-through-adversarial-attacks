# AdAug-Learning-Augmentations-through-adversarial-attacks
In this project, we propose an adversarial attack framework that learns an optimal configurations of augmentations for improving model generalization and robustness and to avoid the expensive search phase for optimization that is used in the policy optimization phase in AutoAugment.
